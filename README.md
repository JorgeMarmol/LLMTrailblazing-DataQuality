This repository contains a demo that integrates advanced data quality techniques with the power of a large language model (LLM), specifically a Llama 7B model called Jellyfish. The demo showcases how LLMs can enhance data quality assessments by automating the detection of errors, anomalies, and inconsistencies with greater intelligence and precision.
